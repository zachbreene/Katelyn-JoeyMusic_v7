<p>Both of us met at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Music Therapy in 2020. Shortly after meeting, we soon found a shared passion for playing an eclectic catalogue of music. In 2021, we began to formulate, rehearse, and refine music for professional live performance. Our love for performing music and our mutual respect and passion for a wide variety of musical genres is our motivation. </p>
